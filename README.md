# Welcome to the course on Finite Element Methods in Engineering.

## Learning outcomes:
After completing this course, students will be able to explain the fundamentals of finite element method (FEM) and it's application in engineering. 

### Fundamentals of FEM

1. Explain the basic concepts of discretization, interpolation functions, degrees of freedom, and element formulation.

2. Describe the advantages, limitations, and assumptions inherent in the finite element method.

### Mathematical Formulation

1. Derive the weak (variational) form of 1D, 2D, and 3D boundary value problems.

2. Construct finite element equations starting from governing differential equations using weighted-residual and energy methods.

### Element Development

1. Develop shape functions for common element types (bar, beam, truss, frame, plane stress/strain, axisymmetric, and solid elements).

2. Assemble element matrices (stiffness, mass, load vectors) into a global system.

### Solution of FE Systems

1. Apply appropriate numerical techniques to solve linear algebraic systems arising from FEM (direct and iterative methods).

2. Implement boundary conditions and constraints correctly.

### Structural and Mechanical Analysis

1. Apply FEM to analyze truss, beam, frame, and continuum structures under static loading.

2. Compute stress, strain, displacement, and reaction forces for structural engineering applications.

### Advanced Topics

1. Analyze dynamic problems using FE formulations for modal analysis, transient dynamics, and vibration response.

2. Apply FEM to nonlinear problems involving material nonlinearity, geometric nonlinearity, and contact.

### Computational Implementation

1. Develop simple FE codes using MATLAB/Julia/Python or similar computational tools.

2. Validate numerical solutions by mesh refinement, error estimation, and comparison with analytical/benchmark solutions.

### Use of Commercial FEM Software

1. Perform engineering simulations using commercial packages (e.g., Abaqus, ANSYS, COMSOL).

2. Interpret simulation outputs, select appropriate element types, and design effective meshing strategies.

### Engineering Judgment and Interpretation

1. Critically interpret FE results and assess the reliability of solutions.

2. Identify modeling errors, numerical issues, and convergence problems.

### Communication and Documentation

Prepare clear engineering reports including problem formulation, model description, simulation setup, results, and conclusions.

Communicate FEM findings effectively through plots, visualizations, and structured explanations.
